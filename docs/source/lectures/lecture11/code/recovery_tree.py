"""L11 demo: a recovery tree with injected failures (py_trees 2.6.0).

Inspection robot 1 must place a cell on a voltage tester. The same
tree runs four separate times, each with its own injected failure:

  A  the place on tester 1 fails once; Retry runs it again
  B  the place on tester 1 fails three times; the selector falls
     back to tester 2
  C  tester 1 reports MALFUNCTIONING while the place is running;
     the guard stops that branch and the selector falls back
  D  as B, with tester 1 still failing, but the selector has
     memory off: it goes back to tester 1 on every tick

No ROS and no simulator: each skill is a stub that follows a
script of outcomes chosen for this example. The stubs follow two
rules of the course skills package (README of v0.2.0, "One goal
per arm" and "Cancel stops the arm and retreats"):

  - robot 1 runs one goal at a time, across all of its skills, and
    rejects a second goal sent while the first still runs; so a
    stub sends its goal only once robot 1 is free, and waits
    (RUNNING) until then
  - a cancel stops the arm, which lifts clear and parks before the
    result CANCELED comes back; here that takes CANCEL_TICKS ticks
    (chosen for this example)

A failed place returns its result after the arm has retreated
(L10, "No Hidden Retries"), so robot 1 is free when a failure
comes back.
