"""Step 6: set the threshold from good cells (SYNTHETIC data).

Twenty good cells pass the lidars. For each, the detector's residual
d is measured, and the threshold is the largest |d| seen, rounded up
to the next 0.1 mm. Range noise of 0.2 mm is chosen for this example:
ARIAC's lidar model.sdf sets no noise element.
