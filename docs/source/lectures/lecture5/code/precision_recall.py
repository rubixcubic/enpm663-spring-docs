"""Precision and recall over a set of SYNTHETIC cells.

200 cells pass the lidars. Each cell is defective with probability
0.25 and then has one defect of a random type, place and depth (all
chosen for this example). A cell is rejected when the detector finds
any defect. The same cells are scored for two lidar layouts.
